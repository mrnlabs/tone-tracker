### Project Summary

This is a Vue.js single-page application called "Tone Tracker" built with Vite. It appears to be a client activation and warehouse management tool. It uses Pinia for state management, Vue Router for routing, and PrimeVue for the UI component library. The application has a well-structured and modular architecture, with a clear separation of concerns between components, services, stores, and routes.

**Key Features:**

*   **Authentication:** User login, logout, forgot password, and reset password functionality.
*   **Role-based access control:** Different user roles (Admin, Activation Manager, Client, Promoter, Warehouse Manager) have different permissions.
*   **Dashboard:** Displays key statistics about activations, promoters, and stock.
*   **Client Management:** CRUD operations for clients.
*   **Activation Management:** CRUD operations for activations, including team assignment and status updates.
*   **Promoter Management:** CRUD operations for promoters.
*   **Warehouse Management:** CRUD operations for stock, including low stock alerts.
*   **Reporting:** A dedicated section for reports.
*   **User Management:** CRUD operations for users.
*   **PWA:** The application is configured as a Progressive Web App.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Centralize API Calls:** The `services` directory is a good start, but the API calls are spread across multiple files. Consider creating a single `api.js` file that exports all the API functions. This would make it easier to manage API endpoints and handle errors consistently.
2.  **Environment Variables:** The `.env.example` file suggests that environment variables are being used, which is great. However, there's no `.env.development` or `.env.production` file in the repository. It's important to ensure that these files are properly configured and that sensitive information is not committed to the repository.
3.  **Component Registration:** In `main.js`, PrimeVue components are registered globally. While this is convenient, it can increase the initial bundle size. Consider using tree-shaking or registering components locally where they are used to reduce the bundle size.
4.  **Code Duplication in Stores:** The Pinia stores for `activations`, `clients`, `reports`, `users`, and `warehouse` have very similar structures and logic. It would be beneficial to create a generic store factory or a composable to reduce code duplication and make the stores more maintainable.
5.  **Error Handling:** The global error handler in `main.js` is a good practice. However, the error handling in the stores could be improved. Instead of just logging errors to the console, consider using a more robust error tracking service and providing more user-friendly error messages.
6.  **Testing:** The project has a testing setup with Vitest, but there are no tests in the `__tests__` directories. Adding unit and component tests would improve the code quality and prevent regressions.
7.  **Documentation:** The `README.md` file is empty. Adding a detailed `README.md` with information about the project, how to set it up, and how to run it would be very helpful for new developers.
8.  **Lazy Loading:** The router uses lazy loading for most of the views, which is good for performance. However, some of the non-lazy loaded views, like the dashboard, could also be lazy-loaded if they are not accessed frequently.
9.  **State Management:** The `stores/index.js` file exports a `useStores` hook that provides access to all the stores. While this is convenient, it can also lead to components being coupled to multiple stores. Consider using a more granular approach where components only import the stores they need.
